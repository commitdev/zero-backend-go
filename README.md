# Zero Backend Service - Golang
This is a [Zero][zero] module which sets up a
service which can be deployed to the environment set up with [zero-aws-eks-stack][zero-infra].

The `/templates` folder is meant to be filled in via [Zero][zero] and results in Simple Go Service with a status endpoint. It also contains a simple CircleCI pipeline which defines how to build and deploy the service.

This repository is language/business-logic agnostic; mainly showcasing some universal best practices:
- Built in containerization with docker
- Deployment flow with kubernetes
- Out of the box CI/CD flow CircleCi
  - testing
  - building docker image
  - uploading docker image to private registry (ECR)
  - deploy with kustomize
  - manual approval step for production environment

```

**Prerequisites**
- Kubernetes Cluster up and running
- Have CircleCI and Github token setup with the Zero project
- CI-user created via EKS-stack with access to ECR and your EKS

## Initialization
This step is meant to be executed during `zero apply`, includes following steps:
- Adding environment variables to CircleCI project
- Linking the CircleCi with the github repository
  - Linking the circleCI will automatically trigger the first build and deploy your application to EKS cluster
